Hello there earth species,
My pseudonym is sakamsantparsbees, the modified name of a fish called Sacabambaspis during the Ordovician period.
Thou my profile appears as a cat, I am actually a fish! Just like every earthlings!

The programming languages skills I currently have are python, html/css/js and lua. Seems like little skills But I will go on my learning adventure from y'all earthlings' docs and tutorials!
