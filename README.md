Hello there earth species,
My pseudonym is sakamsantparsbees, the modified name of a fish called Sacabambaspis during the Ordovician period.
Thou my profile appears as a cat, I am actually a fish! Just like every earthlings!

The skills I currently have are python, html/css/js, lua, inkscape, basic photoshop. Seems like little skills but mark my words. I will go on my learning adventure from y'all earthlings' trails such as docs and tutorials!
